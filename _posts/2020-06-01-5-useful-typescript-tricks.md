## Higher-order Components

In React [higher order components (HOC)](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) are very useful tools. Generally they are used to wrap some layout or functionality to some other component. They are simply functions that return another component: basically the same pattern as decorators.

In typescript it can be confusing how to write them _maintaining the right props_ after wrapping the original component. Here you are:

```typescript
import React from "react";

function withLayout<P extends object>(
  WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType<P>
) {
  return (props: P) => (
    <div id="app">
      <Header />
      <WrappedComponent {...props} />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note also that when using the `withLayout` you donâ€™t need to specify the generic type explicitly, as typescript will inherit from the function parameter. Super handy!

## Smarter constructors

Letâ€™s start by the building block this is based on. Itâ€™s a basic Javascript trick, not a typescript exclusive at first.

```typescript
class Pizza {
  slices: number;
  name: string;

  constructor(init) {
    Object.assign(this, init);
  }
}

const pizza = new Pizza({
  slices: 8,
  name: "Margherita",
});
```

What is happening here? With the super handy `Object.assign` simply assigns the object to the class. This is super handy when classes have many constructor parameters. But this is NOT type safe as your IDE/Editor will tell you. How do we fix this?

```typescript
import { NonFunctionKeys } from "utility-types";

class Pizza {
  slices!: number;
  name?: string;

  constructor(init: Pick<Pizza, NonFunctionKeys<Pizza>>) {
    Object.assign(this, init);
  }

  eat() {
    this.slices = 0;
  }
}

const pizza = new Pizza({
  slices: 8,
  name: "Margherita",
});
```

Let me explain what happens:
This leverages the awesome [utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types) package. We first take all the keys that are not a function, so we donâ€™t overwrite the `eat` method of the class. Then we pick those from the general Pizza type.

This means that `slices` will be required, while `name` will be optional, as they are defined.

## Type-checking Functions

Did you know you can write functions to tell typescript what type something is? This is awesome!

Suppose we have the following interfaces

```typescript
interface Food {
  name: string;
}

interface Pasta extends Food {
  type: "Spaghetti" | "Fusilli";
}

interface Pizza extends Food {
  slices: number;
}
```

Now we could write a `cook` function that accepts both Pasta and Pizza. Typescript itself cannot differentiate between the too.

```typescript
function cook(what: Food) {
  if(what === Pizza) ????
}
```

Fortunately there is a nice solution built into typescript.

```typescript
function isPizza(x: Food | Pizza): x is Pizza {
  return x.hasOwnProperty("slices");
}

function isPasta(x: Food | Pasta): x is Pasta {
  return x.hasOwnProperty("type");
}

function cook(plate: Food) {
  if (isPizza(plate)) {
    // Plate is now of type Pizza
    putInTheOven(plate);
  }
  if (isPasta(plate)) {
    // Plate is now of type Pasta
    putInThePan(plate);
  }
}
```

Here we define two functions that return `x is Sometype` and return a boolean value based on the input. Itâ€™s up to you of course to define it properly, but this can be very useful in various situations.

## Discriminated unions

```typescript
type Sqlite = {
  type: "sqlite";
  database: string;
};

type PostgreSQL = {
  type: "postgresql";
  database: string;
  host: string;
  post?: number;
};

type PossibleConfigs = Sqlite | PostgreSQL;

function initialize(config: PossibleConfigs) {}
```

This might look like a simple one, but I often see people putting those sorts of types all into the same interface. By separating the different type of objects you make sure that they are safe. Also the autocomplete will thank you.

## Optional Chaining & Null Coalescing

This are future features that will be introduced in Typescript 3.7 that are very useful and will not be lived without after the release in early November 2019.

Optional chaining is an obvious shorthand. Every time you need to check if a property (especially if nested) exists, you need to do lots of repetitive checking. No more!

```typescript
a && a.b && a.b.c; // ðŸ¤¬

a?.b?.c; // ðŸš€
```

Null coalescing is also a very useful shorthand. You all know the `||` shorthand, often used to initialize a variable if no value is given.

```typescript
const option = something || "default";

// Sugar for
const option = !!something ? something : "default";
```

The problem is with values that are actual values, but result as falsy.

```typescript
false || "default"; // => 'default'
0 || "default"; // => 'default'
```

This is where the Null Coalescing comes in.

```typescript
const option = something ?? "default"; // ðŸš€

// Sugar for
const option = x === null || x === undefined ? "default" : x;

0 ?? "default"; // => 0
false ?? "default"; // => false
```

Basically it only assign the default value if the provided one is `null` or `undefined` so that values like `false` or `0` donâ€™t get overwritten.
